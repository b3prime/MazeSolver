# MazeSolver
Created as part of Harvard's CS50 Intro to AI course. Uses the concept of frontiers, nodes, search-theory, and the manhattan-distance heuristic to solve user-generated mazes!

*Creating Mazes*
Either use one of my five mazes, or create your own! They:
- Must be rectangular
- Must have one starting point (A)
- Must have one ending point (B)

*Running Code*
In "maze.py" change line 154 to indicate which maze you wish to solve! Then, run the code

*Viewing Solution*
Open "mazeOutput.png", and view the program's solution!
